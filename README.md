# Baseball Simulator

This project is intended to be a baseball simulator game. It should have the ability to simulate entire seasons of a fictional baseball league as well as the option to simulate a player's career. If the latter, the player will get to play the game instead of just simulating games.

## Details

To run, you must:
* ./gradlew build
* java -jar build/libs/baseball-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 

To view test results, you must:
* firefox build/reports/tests/test/index.html
